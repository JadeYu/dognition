I. use test timing to generate PCA features for mapping (can do 3D?)
	- mid, across-month distribution and within-day distribution (morning, noon, afternoon and night)
	- 1 + 11 + 3 = 15 variables

II. each selection of dog feature will highlight dogs on the PCA map

III. calculate similarity score using one tailed p value of the distance distribution on the PCA map
